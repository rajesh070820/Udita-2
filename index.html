      <h1>Udita</h1>
      <p>From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. Your name, which means "one who has risen," perfectly captures the light you bring into my world. You’ve lifted my spirits, my dreams, and my heart to places I never knew existed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <p>Every day with you feels like a beautiful melody, where every note is filled with love, laughter, and the warmth of your presence. Your smile is my favorite sunrise, and your kindness is the gentle breeze that soothes my soul. I am endlessly grateful for the way you love me, the way you see me, and the way you make life so incredibly beautiful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <p>Udita, you are my calm in the chaos, my strength in the storm, and my joy in every moment. I cherish the way we laugh together, dream together, and grow together. You are my everything, and I am so lucky to call you mine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <p>Thank you for being you—my love, my partner, my forever. I love you more than words can ever express, and I promise to spend every day making you as happy as you make me.</p>
    </div>

      <p>With all my heart,<br>Motorshuti</p>
